# Triangle & Wiki

Luckily I have the pdf for this assignment, so you can just read that.

## What:

Two separate assignments: first draws a vertical rhombus / diamond out of ASCII characters. The second takes a text file and extracts wiki
links from it. 

## What is happening right now?

For the triangle I finished the first part of the assignment, but I could not draw the Sierpinski triangle. (At this point I probably could).

The second part is complete.
The task was to extract all links to wikipidea with a title from a text file with a bunch of html formatted
lines such as `<a href="/wiki/PageName" ... title = "PageName"> description </a>`. If the line was missing a title we would ignore it.
If it did not lead to wikipedia we would also ignore it.

## To-do

Sierpinski triangle!!!
